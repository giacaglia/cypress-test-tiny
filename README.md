# cypress-test-tiny

Reproducing the problem that we've encountered with Cypress 8 where we are getting network failures between tests.

In order to run this test, you need to run the following:

```
yarn start
```

This starts the Express server.

In order to run the Cypress tests, you need to run the following command:

```
yarn cypress open
```
